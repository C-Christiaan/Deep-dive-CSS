This version of the Bit Academy was an exersize for my study. The languages I use are HTML, PHP, Javascript and Bootstrap

As you can see, it's not finished yet. This exersize is made without any knowledgde of Bootstrap or Javascript and a little knowledge of HTML. For a timeframe of 6 hours, its something to be proud of.

The code has a PHP-unction when you click 'no' and send it, you'll recive a thank you page. When you click 'yes' you'll recive a text-area for your emailadres to get some more information.
