# Bit Academy Website

This version of the Bit Academy website was created as an exercise for a study program. The implemented languages include HTML, PHP, JavaScript, and Bootstrap.

As evident, the website is currently unfinished. This exercise was undertaken without prior knowledge of Bootstrap or JavaScript and with only a basic understanding of HTML. Given the 6-hour timeframe, it is a commendable accomplishment.

The code includes a PHP function that triggers when the user clicks 'no' and submits the form, leading to a thank-you page. On the other hand, selecting 'yes' prompts a text area for the user to input their email address for receiving additional information.
